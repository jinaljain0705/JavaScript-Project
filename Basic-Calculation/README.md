# 🧮 Basic Calculation in JavaScript

This is a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates **basic arithmetic operations** using two variables `X` and `Y`.
It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, then displays the results in a clean, formatted way in the console.

## 📋 Features

* **Addition** (`X + Y`)
* **Subtraction** (`X - Y`)
* **Multiplication** (`X * Y`)
* **Division** (`X / Y`)
* **Modulus** (`X % Y`)

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Two numbers `X` and `Y` are defined.
2. Each arithmetic operation is calculated and stored in separate variables.
3. The results are logged to the console with a readable format.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **JavaScript** – for logic and calculations
* **Console.log()** – for output display

## ▶️ Usage

1. Copy the code into a `.js` file.
2. Run it in a browser console or Node.js environment.
3. View the results in the console output.

If you want, I can also make a **fun, beginner-friendly version** with emojis and math symbols so the README feels more interactive and engaging.
